            <h3>AirPods Max 2: release date rumours, potential price, features and spec leaks</h3>
            <p>The AirPods Max are one of the best wireless headphones on the market, especially for Apple users, despite having made their debut all the way back in 2020.
Featuring a suite of excellent features, including wonderfully cinematic spatial audio, brilliant sound quality, a reliable battery life, and a comfortable, but sturdy, build they remain a staple recommendation from our reviews team for any Apple user.
This is why you may justifiably be wondering when Apple is going to release a follow-up to its five-star wireless over-ears. Recently you may also have dared to hope they’ll appear at Apple’s latest 12 September event, which was announced at the end of August 2023.
Here to help manage your expectations and keep you apprised of all the latest rumours and industry gossip, we’ve created this AirPods Max 2 guide. In it, our team of reviewers has rounded up all the latest credible-looking rumors doing the rounds and offered a few ideas on what Apple would need to do to keep its space among the creme-de-la-creme in the current market.
It's currently up in the air when the second generation Max will debut, as there are very few convincing rumours doing the rounds at the moment. As an added layer of complexity, we only have one generation to go off, so it's quite hard to get a hard read on Apple's release strategy with the AirPods Max.
That leaves it pretty hard to tell if the AirPods Max 2 will appear at Apple's latest 12 September event.
Apple kept us waiting for the AirPods Max; they were expected to debut alongside the iPhone 12 which launched on 12th October 2020 but "complications" in the design and manufacturing process put paid to that. Instead, the AirPods Max were finally unveiled on Tuesday 8th December, before going on sale on Tuesday 15th December 2020.
Given that Apple replaced the AirPods 2 wireless earbuds with the AirPods 3 buds after just a couple of years, there was talk of an AirPods Max update in 2022. We wondered whether we'd see the rumoured AirPods Max 2 debut alongside the iPhone 14 and AirPods Pro 2 in September. Alas, that did not happen.
Leaks were few and far between last year, though Mark Gurman's Power On newsletter last May claimed that an AirPods Max update could be imminent: "Look out for an AirPods Max refresh with new colours (and, we hope, a price drop - $550 is absurd for those headphones)".
It certainly raised our hopes that we could see them break cover over Christmas last year, though our expectations were muted by remarks by respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who said the next-gen AirPods Max could arrive alongside cheaper AirPods (AirPods Lite?) in the second half of 2024. Or even 2025!
That would be an uncharacteristically long wait between generations of products for Apple, though perhaps the upgrade would be more significant for that gap. The likelihood is that we'll see an update to the original AirPods Max model first, refreshing appetites for the model before a sequel comes along shortly after, similar to games companies throwing out a quick remaster ahead of a brand new title.
Stay tuned and we'll bring you all the latest AirPods Max 2 release date rumours as they slip out.
